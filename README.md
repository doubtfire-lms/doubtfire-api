## Getting started

### Clone Repository

First, clone the `doubtfire-api` repository to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-api
```

### Install script

The install script will try to setup the development environment for either macOS or Linux, and can be found in the root of the project as `setup.sh`. Execute it as follows:

```
$ cd ./doubtfire-api
$ ./setup.sh
```

### Manual install

The manual installation guide can be found on the wiki for: [Linux](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-api/wiki/Manual-install-on-Linux), [macOS](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-api/wiki/Manual-install-on-macOS), or [Docker](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-api/wiki/Getting-Started-Using-Docker).

## Environment variables

Doubtfire requires multiple environment variables that help define settings about the Doubtfire instance running. Whilst these will default to other values, you may want to override them in production.

You may choose to keep your environment variables inside a `.env` file using key-value pairs:

```
DF_INSTITUTION_HOST=doubtfire.unifoo.edu.au
DF_INSTITUTION_NAME="University of Foo"
```

You can also keep multiple `.env` files for different environments, e.g.: `.env.production` is different to `.env.develoment`. Doubtfire uses the [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem to make this happen.


### Get it up and running!

Once you've installed using either in install script or the manual install steps.

```
$ bundle exec rails s
```

You should see all the Doubtfire endpoints at **[http://localhost:3000/api/docs/](http://localhost:3000/api/docs/)**, which means the API is running.

# Running Rake Tasks

You can perform developer-specific tasks using `rake`. For a list of all tasks, execute in the root directory:

```
rake --tasks
```

# Testing

Our aim with testing Doubtfire is to migrate to a [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
strategy, testing all new models and API endpoints (although we plan on writing
more tests for _existing_ models and API endpoints). If you are writing a new
API endpoint or model, we strongly suggest you include unit tests in the
appropriate folders (see below).

To run unit tests, execute:

```bash
$ rake test
```

Unit tests are located in the `test` directory, where **model** tests are under
the `model` subdirectory and **API** tests are under the `api` subdirectory.

Any **helpers** should be included in the `helpers` subdirectory and helper
modules should be written under the `TestHelpers` module.
