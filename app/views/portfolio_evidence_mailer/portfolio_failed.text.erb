Hi <%= @student.first_name %>,

There was an error compiling your portfolio. This usually means that one of your task PDFs is corrupt. Login to Doubtfire and check each of your task PDFs. Once you have checked that all of the PDFs are valid you can schedule your portfolio to compile again.

Cheers,
The Doubtfire Team!
