Hi <%= @student.first_name %>,

<% if @project.portfolio_auto_generated %>Profile generation has been automatically triggered. You can customise your portfolio and recreate up until the due date indicated by the teaching staff.<% end %>

There was an error compiling your portfolio. This usually means that one of your task PDFs is corrupt. Login to <%= @doubtfire_product_name %> and check each of your task PDFs. Once you have checked that all of the PDFs are valid you can schedule your portfolio to compile again.

Cheers,
The <%= @doubtfire_product_name %> Team on behalf of <%= @convenor.name %>
